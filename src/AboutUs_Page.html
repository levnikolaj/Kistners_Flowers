    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <img src="Owners_AboutUs.jpg" alt="AboutUs Owners">
    <p>
      <b>Kistner's Flowers has been serving Manhattan and surrounding area's for over 70 years.</b> Kistner's Flowers was started in 1946 By Ray and Marie Kistner who had a love for flowers and bedding plants and were looking for a way to provide a quality product to the Manhattan area.  In 1974 the business was sold to the Orr-Lee family who slowy changed from cut flowers and bedding plants to fresh flowers and Interior Plantscaping.  In 2006 Matt and Bronwyn Douglas, who are both Kansas State Graduates, purchased the company from the Orr-Lee's after having worked at Kistner's for a number of years. In 2018 Matt and Bronwyn were both awarded the prestigious title of AIFD and CFD.  The company is still the same in providing quality fresh flowers and growing in the field of designing, installing, and maintaining interior plantscapes.  We are still family owned and operated and are committed to offering only the finest floral arrangements and gifts, backed by service that is friendly and prompt.   Our professional staff has over 30 years of experience and is dedicated to making your experience a pleasant one. That is why we always go the extra mile to make your floral gift perfect.
